#Introduction
Today we are making a map using RMarkdown with Plastic pollution datasets from past Tidy Tuesdays.The global movement envisioning a future free from plastic pollution.Since its launch in 2016, more than 13,000 organizations and individual supporters from across the world have joined the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement to demand massive reductions in single-use plastics and to push for lasting solutions to the plastic pollution crisis.
